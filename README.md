# Visual Inspection Cell Project

## Introduction
**Visual Inspection Cell Project** is a robotic system designed for automated visual inspection using a Universal Robot (UR) combined with a vision system.
The project aims to improve quality control processes by automating the detection and classification of product defects in a production environment.

## Features
- **Automated visual inspection** using advanced computer vision algorithms.
- Integration with a **UR10e robot** for precise and repeatable movements.
- Customizable workflows for inspecting different types of products.
- Real-time defect detection and classification.
- Easy-to-configure calibration scripts for robot kinematics and camera alignment.

## Technologies
- **Python** for control scripts and automation.
- **OpenCV** for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **RTDE** for data exchange between the robot and external systems.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
